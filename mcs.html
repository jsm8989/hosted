         I'm still looking around to remotely access a bunch of things I thought I might be able to get to, like Labview (or even matlab). Furthermore, this is useful for things like python or c++ where loads of the libraries are already installed. I'm not entirely sure how it works but I think it might also used the MCS computing rather than your local machine, meaning (at least in my case) you can do a lot more
