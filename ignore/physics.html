	<h1>Things you would hear in physics but sound weird (almost) everywhere else</h1>
	<p>(mostly direct quotes from part II/III lecturers, supervisors or even
	problem sheets or exam questions. Sometimes slightly paraphrased. Sorry about that.)</p>
	<ul>
		<li></li>
		<li></li>
		<li></li>
		<li></li>
		<li>If this doesn't mean anything to you, don't worry, it's just there for the experts</li>
		<li>It's a very approximate theory, but therefore it is also easy to handle, and therefore even I as an experimentalist can present it</li>
		<li>Ginzberg-Landau phenomenology is a coarse-grained theory based only on fundamental symmetries</li>
		<li>Measuring critical exponents requires experimental genius</li>
		<li>Ken Wilson made the most important theoretical discovery of the last century</li>
		<li>It doesn't make sense to ask whether a single water molecule is "ice", "vapour" etc</li>
		<li>In superconducitivity, the best way to make progress is to avoid theorists (K&oumln group on CeCu2Si2)</li>
		<li>The example sheet is not very refined, so look at the books instead</li>
		<li>Most of the planets are hot Earths</li>
		<li>H two is a fantastically symmetric molecule; this is why we can see so far into the universe</li>
		<li>"I can predict that Jupiter doesn't exist" (back in the day given certain approximations)</li>
		<li>We're going to look at photography for a bit</li>
		<li>The Bohr boundary is in human conciousness</li>
		<li>How do we get to Charles Smith's dilution refridgerator?</li>
		<li>Here are some pictures of ducks</li>
		<li>Non-unitary behaviour sort of comes from ignorance</li>
		<li>Kramer's paper is extremely difficult to comprehend</li>
		<li>The Buks 1998 result was a little controversial, but they are such a prestigious group that one has to give them a bit of the benefit of doubt</li>
		<li>Zurek ran past on the beach, then 10 mins later ran past again - in the same direction (around Heron Island...)</li>
		<li>Lucien Hardy was not happy with this set of postulates (see his paper titled "Quantum Theory from 5 reasonable axioms")</li>
		<li>These are my mates, so I had to include their books in the bibliography</li>
		<li>Purely virtual resonances are stronger for smaller detuning, so will have a time delay for real transitions (I did not get the physics here)</li>
		<li>Photon shampoo commercial - at least they got something right (*check)</li>
		<li>Do the courses you are exctied by, you don't have much time left in Cambridge, the exams for this term will be kinder (*check)</li>
		<li>This paper would lose points in 1A (on the first experimental report of a laser, Maiman Nature 1960)</li>
		<li>Light in different modes exchanges energy, so we can get lightsabers (*check this)</li>
		<li>We assume all lasers to be perfectly single-frequency and to contain enough intensity such that semi-classical description is valid (=no shot noise).</li>
		<li>You can't get fizzy drinks in the perfect quantum state</li>
		<li>Consider the linearised motion of a non-gravitating simple hyperelastic fluid about
a stress-free equilibrium configuration</li>
		<li>If an explosion is detonated at a point on the
upper surface of the layer, describe qualitatively and explain the major seismic
phases you would expect to record on a seismograph located on the upper surface
at a distance X from the source.</li>
		<li>The Thomas precession factor does not occur in the hyperfine structure because the frame is not rotating</li>
		<li>Everything is a fluid if you wait long enough</li>
		<li>Scaling is exactly like dimensional analysis but with physical intuition; it is arguably harder but much more useful</li>
		<li>There is no material for which Hooke's law is exactly true; elasticity is inherently nonlinear</li>
		<li>If you don't impose conservation of angular momentum, it's not there</li>
		<li>It's all classical physics so it's essentially trivial</li>
		<li>What does "most of the time" mean?</li>
		<li>[I'm] using "homogeneous" in three different ways in the sae lecutre; it's a maths problem, not me</li>
		<li>This is a material with cubic symmetry, which is to say the strain energy function is invariant under rotations by 90* about orthogonal axes</li>
		<li>Mutations fall on lineages of the coalescent genealogy [eww, biology!]</li>	
	<li></li>
		<li>What density of water would be needed for a normal-sized human swimming at normal human speed to have the same Reynolds number as that of <i>E. Coli</i>?</li>
    	<li>The Klein-Gordon equation lasted about 3ms, due to predicting both positive and negative energies. Any self-respecting particle would go "weee" [paraphrased]</li>
   	<li>If a set of quantities when contracted with an arbitrary tensor produce another tensor, the original set of quantities form the components of a tensor.</li>
    	<li>If I'm giving this lecture and somebody taps me on the shoulder suddenyl from the back, I'll probably stop being coherent, I'll stumble and restart my discussion. Something similar happens with the wavefield when collisions happen between atoms.
	</li>
   	<li>Solid state physics is concerned with the abundance of properties that arise when atoms are amalgamated together. 
		Much of what we think of as <q>core physics</q> is deliberately reductionist; we look for the very simplest unified description of a basic 
		phenomenon, and the progress of much of basic physics has always been a progress toward grander unified theories, 
		each of which is simpler (at least in concept) than the previous generation.
		Condensed matter physics is not like this.</li>
	<li>
		Materials <i>per se</i>, are not perhaps so interesting to the physicist,
		but the remarkable feature of condensed matter is the wealth of hysical properties that can be explored through novel arrangements of atoms.
	</li>
	<li>
		The notion of diagonalising a subspace to yield new eignevalues is a key concept in QM. In fact, <i>spectral line splitting</i> is a phrase we are all happy to use in general discussion
	</li>
	<li>
		In short, for a degenerate subspace, the eigenstates are not unique. That is, weighted linear combinations of degenerate eigenstates are also eigenstates.
	</li>
	<li>
		Einstein realised that the atoms which are 'disappearing' from the integrand are piling up in the ground state...
	</li>
	<li>
		In space, h diverges for both of these systems. So for our first try at using k_B T to define these systems fails miserably.
	</li>
	<li>
		... Hence show that if a uniform spherical cloud with a frozen in magnetic field contracts homogeneously, the number of Jeans masses it contains is constant
	</li>
	<li>
		The challenge [with nuclear fusion] is to generate more power than expended. Maybe this is something you'd like to do
	</li>
	<li>
		If you find that the nuclear shell model is not working 
		as perhaps it should with the unpaired nucleon using the
		j and l values of the shell that it's sitting in,
		try changing the pairing interaction so that the
		pairing energy is actually greater for this configuration
		rather than this configuration. 
		For example, this will give us the right answer for lead-207.
	</li>
	<li>
		The dark matter problem is still a very hard problem. It's somewhat a surprise to me that we haven't found a solution yet
	</li>
	<li>
		Let me just end by showing you a nice movie of Alfven waves in the sun
	</li>
	<li>
		Maybe I should just put the coordinate system down in the corner... there we go, nice and right-handed, as it should be
	</li>
	<li>
		Show that the induced charge density is then of the form n_induced is proportional to e to the minus r over squiggle, divided by r ... I know that's not the correct greek name; unfortunately I've forgotten what it is
	</li>
	<li>
		In a magnetic field, the allowed k-states no longer form a regular lattice as k is not a good quantum number
	</li>
	<li>
		This model raises more questions for me than it answers
	</li>
	<li>
		What would you expect to be the Drell-Yan cross-sections for pp and (antip)p collisions compared with the Drell-Yan cross-section for (pi+)p interactions? 
	</li>
	<li>
		A stellar wind behaves as a steady adiabatic spherical outflow of a perfect monatomic gas.	
	</li>
	<li>
		Consider a spherically-symmetric, self-gravitating system in hydrostatic equilibrium; from now on we will refer to this as a "star"
	</li>
	<li>
		Add SUSY, and the running of the couplings is modified, because sparticle loops contribute as well as particle loops
	</li>
	<li>
		I won't be teaching you Python, I'll be giving you motivation for why you should teach yourself Python
	</li>
	<li>
		This gets you a nice Nobel Prize - all from doing a Fourier Transform
	</li>
	<li>
		He was a little eccentric, but if you're a real physicist you know that is, of course, not unusual	
	</li>
	<li>
		The colour of copper depends on the band structure of... um... well... copper
	</li>
	<li>
		Sorry for the noise, my neighbour is currently warming up her car
	</li>
	<li>
		Now know that at least some of these sources are neutron stars that are accreting at super-Eddington rates from a companion star		
	</li>
	<li>
		The concept of entropic interaction was usually used in a subjunctive mood
	</li>
	<li>
		In this sense the term hydrophobicity ("water fearing") is somewhat of a misnomer since it is more the water that <q>fears</q> the presence of the solutes rather than the solutes that fear the water	
	</li>
	<li>
		The "duty" is defined in units of one million foot-pounds of energy per bushel of coal. I think you will all agree that this is the ultimate non-SI unit
	</li>
	<li>
		Kelvin after meeting Joule in 1847: "About a fortnight later, I was walking down from Chamounix to commence the tour of Mont Blanc, and whom should I meet walking up but Joule, with a long thermometer in his hand, and a carriage with a lady in it not far off. He told me that he had married since we parted at Oxford and he was going to try for the elevation of temperature in waterfalls"
	</li>
	<li>
		As usual I'm going to set factors of order unity equal to unity
	</li>
	<li>
		If a circumterrestrial disk forms with 2-4 times lunar mass within Roche radius, then an object like the moon will coalesce out of it
	</li>
	</ul>
