# hosted
This (the *master-new* branch) is hosted on my website at jsm89.user.srcf.net/hub
When I understand git better I will change this to the main branch, don't you worry :)

Anyone can contribute to this page. 
I will always make edits/upload them to this github repo first, then pull those edits into the server directory.
Method for doing this is as follows:
- ssh into the srcf server, and go to ~/public_html/hub
- this directory has been initialised as a git repository, and is nicely connected to github (following all sorts of things with personal access tokens and encryption keys etc)
- type `git pull origin master` and the changes should be merged
- any changes to the site should be visible fairly quickly
- note that pushing from the server to the github repo requires the PAT and my github username (jsm8989)

The stuff in ignore is a temporary way for me to add stuff to a different section of the website without having to connect a different repo

Kieran: I've added a helpful guide to Wales and Whales, just in case anyone is confused.
